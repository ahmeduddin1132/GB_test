Yes in my recent project at playstation, i was working on QA ticket to update python version and all the libraries required by automation framework in CI/CD process. 

The requirement to update all libraries was crucial since we need to test out an important feature on mobile application using latest selenium before the deadline.

I have updated the python version and all libraries to latest everything working fine on local machine.

My PR got approved by my colleges since i shared my successfull tests on the change.

However, when i merged my PR to master branch all pipeline started to fail on automation stage and all production pipeline was failing leading to HOLD the release process.

The issue was selenium was not able to create driver instance it was failing on URLLIB3 library.

After some time debugging i discover the latest urllib3 has a function lacking on creating connections on PROXY.

I had to manually patch the library to add function in the library to support proxy connection.
